AXI Stream:
	- Global
		- clk
		- rst_n
	- Write address channel(AW)
		- awvalid
		- awready
		- awaddr
		- arprot (protection)
	- Write data channel(W)
		- wvalid
		- wready
		- wdata
		- wstrb
	- Write response channel(B)
		- bvalid
		- bready
		- bresp
	- Read Address channel(AR)
		- arvalid
		- arready
		- araddr
		- arprot
	- Read Data channel(R)
		- rvalid
		- rready
		- rdata
		- rresp

Rules:-
1. Valid can't depend on ready
2. Data remains constant when valid stays high
3. Valid reamins high until the transaction is over
4. Transaction ends when both ready and valid are deasserted
5. BVALID must only be asserted after W and SW transactions(for write operation) and AR transaction(for read operation)
