🧭 RISC-V 5-Stage CPU Project — Milestones
🟦 M0 — Project Reset & Infra Bring-up

Goal: Clean slate, tools working

Archive old Verilog into legacy/

New repo structure (rtl/, tb/, sim/, docs/)

SystemVerilog-only rule

Verilator + cocotb + pyUVM runs a dummy test

CI or local make sim works

✅ Done when: smoke test runs with no DUT logic

🟦 M1 — Architecture Freeze (no RTL yet)

Goal: Lock decisions so RTL doesn’t churn

Memory interface (valid/ready, byte enables)

Pipeline stage contract (valid/enable/flush)

Stall & flush policy written down

CSR scope frozen (M-mode minimal set)

Reset & trap behavior documented

✅ Done when: architecture doc exists and is agreed

🟦 M2 — DV Bring-up (Before CPU)

Goal: Testbench exists before design

pyUVM env skeleton

Memory agent with:

random wait states

byte-enable correctness

Clock/reset driver

Scoreboard stub

test_smoke.py (reset + NOPs)

✅ Done when: TB runs without a CPU

🟦 M3 — Pipeline Skeleton (No Real ISA Yet)

Goal: Pipeline moves instructions end-to-end

IF stage with real memory handshake

IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB registers

Stall & flush wiring works

PC update logic correct

All stages propagate valid

✅ Done when: instructions flow without deadlock

🟦 M4 — Minimal RV32I Execution

Goal: First real instructions work

Register file

ADD, ADDI

WB correctness

Load-use stall (no forwarding yet)

✅ Done when: basic arithmetic tests pass

🟦 M5 — Full RV32I ALU + Branches

Goal: Core control flow correctness

All RV32I ALU ops

Branches + jumps

Flush on taken branch

PC redirection correct

✅ Done when: branch-heavy tests pass

🟦 M6 — Real Load/Store Subsystem

Goal: FPGA-realistic memory behavior

Byte/half/word loads & stores

Sign/zero extension

MEM-stage stalls handled

Random-latency memory DV tests

✅ Done when: memory stress tests pass

🟦 M7 — CSR + Trap Support (M-Mode)

Goal: Non-toy CPU

CSRRW / CSRRS / CSRRC

ECALL, EBREAK

Illegal instruction trap

Correct mepc, mcause, mtval, mtvec

mret

✅ Done when: trap tests pass reliably

🟦 M8 — Compliance-Style & Random Testing

Goal: Confidence

Directed ISA tests

Random instruction streams (bounded)

Memory latency fuzzing

No deadlocks, no Xs

✅ Done when: long random sims complete cleanly

🟦 M9 — FPGA Bring-up

Goal: Runs on real hardware

BRAM-backed instruction & data memory

Reset vector & linker script

Bare-metal program boots

Optional UART output

✅ Done when: program runs on FPGA

🟦 M10 — Polish & Documentation

Goal: Repo that others respect

Architecture doc

Pipeline diagrams

DV overview

“How to run” guide

Known limitations listed

✅ Done when: someone else can build it

🎯 Final Reality Check
