🧭 RISC-V 5-Stage CPU Project — Milestones

# Completed # 
🟦 M0 — Project Reset & Infra Bring-up
🟦 M1 — Architecture Freeze (no RTL yet)
🟦 M2 — DV Bring-up (Before CPU)
🟦 M3 — Pipeline Skeleton (No Real ISA Yet)
🟦 M4 — Minimal RV32I Execution
🟦 M5 — Full RV32I ALU + Branches
🟦 M6 — Real Load/Store Subsystem

🟦 -- > Spike and GRM addition
🟦 -- > Compliance test passing
🟦 -- > RTL Pipeline optimization, and add scalability features

🟦 M7 — CSR + Trap Support (M-Mode)

Goal: Non-toy CPU

CSRRW / CSRRS / CSRRC

ECALL, EBREAK

Illegal instruction trap

Correct mepc, mcause, mtval, mtvec

mret

✅ Done when: trap tests pass reliably

🟦 M8 — Compliance-Style & Random Testing

Goal: Confidence

Directed ISA tests

Random instruction streams (bounded)

Memory latency fuzzing

No deadlocks, no Xs

✅ Done when: long random sims complete cleanly

🟦 M9 — FPGA Bring-up

Goal: Runs on real hardware

BRAM-backed instruction & data memory

Reset vector & linker script

Bare-metal program boots

Optional UART output

✅ Done when: program runs on FPGA

🟦 M10 — Polish & Documentation

Goal: Repo that others respect

Architecture doc

Pipeline diagrams

DV overview

“How to run” guide

Known limitations listed

✅ Done when: someone else can build it

🎯 Final Reality Check

🟦 CAN IT RUN DOOM?
